Perfectionist and dedicated, I love solving problems
and discovering new working methods.

Also addicted to **crafting**, specially crochet, ceramics and miniatures.

## Softwares and Languages:
* Maya
* Python
* Qt
* Substance Designer

## Hey, what’s in the *pipeline*?
I'm currently working on a **"Marvelous Designer to Maya Workflow"** tool to improve the retopology and pattern merging process.

I also have another **Origami Maya tool** in the oven, based on the mathematical theory from *Robert J. Lang* (I really recommend his book *"Origami Design Secrets"*).
